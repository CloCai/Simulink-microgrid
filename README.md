# 24 hours simulation of a microgrid

- [x] Create a readme
- [ ] Write about the pupose of this simulation
-  This project, working in collaboration with the Royal University of Bhutan is aimed at developing the design tools needed to build a prototype PV-microgrid at the College of Science and Technology in Bhutan. This project will be supporting this Microgrid at CST by proposing a design tool that can identify the following:
- Optimal microgrid structure and composition
- Full year simulation of the system, with measurements on load, production, voltage and frequency
- Methods for simplifying the planning and resource-assessment phase
- [ ] Write about the feature of the simulation
- [ ] Write about how to compile (what compiler is needed)
- [ ] CHECK! and then write about supported operating systems
- [ ] Usefull links (how to upload excel files)
- [ ] Make a to-do for future work and improvements
