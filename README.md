# 24 hours simulation of a microgrid
This model is based on Faisal Mohamed's master thesis, Microgrid Modelling and Simulation.

## What is a microgrid
The microgrid simulated use a group of electricity sources and loads to work disconnected from any centralized grid (macrogrid) and function autonomously to provide power to its local area. The simulation models the microgrid at steady state to analyse their transient response to changing input. 

## Purpose of this simulation
Design tools are needed to build the prototype PV-microgrid at the College of Science and Technology in Bhutan. This project will be supporting this Microgrid at CST by proposing a design tool that can
* Identify optimal microgrid structure and composition
* Give a full year simulation of the system, with measurements on load, production, voltage and frequency
* Give methods for simplifying the planning and resource-assessment phase

The simulation is a complete model of a microgrid including the power sources, their power electronics, a load and mains model using MatLab and Simulink.







- [ ] Write about the feature of the simulation
- [ ] Write about how to compile (what compiler is needed)
- [ ] CHECK! and then write about supported operating systems
- [ ] Usefull links (how to upload excel files)
- [ ] Make a to-do for future work and improvements
The final goal is to obtain a reliable 24h simulation for a PV microgrid, with the possibility to add another system whatever the king of ressource we have for this backup.
To do:
- Create a GUI in order to control and visualize the simulation
- Implement the integration of a backup in the simulink
- Run a complete simulation
- Analyse the results
- Create a Wiki
